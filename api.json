      "full": "The Dover Demon is a cryptid reported during a brief 25-hour period in April 1977 in Dover, Massachusetts. Four teenage witnesses independently described a bizarre humanoid creature standing 3-4 feet tall with a disproportionately large, watermelon-shaped head, glowing orange eyes, long thin fingers, and rough peach-colored or gray skin. The creature was bipedal and hairless. Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman investigated the sightings and coined the name 'Dover Demon.' The witnesses drew sketches independently that showed remarkable consistency. Theories range from alien visitor to unknown cryptid to misidentified animal (particularly a moose calf). No further sightings have been reported since April 22, 1977, making it one of the most concentrated and enigmatic cryptid events in American folklore."
